# Changelog
## Apr 21, 2022
### Shortened QFT
- Shortened QFT's freeze code by replacing C2 with 04(bl@event) and 07.
- Reserve `817F0348`~`817F03BF` (120 bytes)

### Reduced code size of Pattern Selector
Reduce 240 bytes of PS by replacing switch case with lookup table.

### Reverted QFT to version 0.5
Codes are getting too big for Nintendont, reverting to a simpler version while we figure out ways to make everything fit.

## Apr 08, 2022
### Implemented custom config of QFT
- Appearance: location, font size, font color, background color (GMSJ01 only)
- Freezing the timer

### Implemented customizable code
- Add code info in `Codes.xml` as other code,
  but you should specify `<id>` and available versions with `<source version="XXX"></source>`
  (the code in `<source>` will be ignored).
- Create directory `site/.vuepress/components/codes/YOUR_CODE_NAME`,
  and create the following two files (file names are arbitrary):
  + `codegen.js`: **export default** a `codegen(version: string): string` function,
    where `version` is the game version (e.g. `GMSJ01`),
    and the return value is the gecko code string.
    The config of the code can be read from localStorage
    (with key = `config/YOUR_CODE_ID` as convention) directly.
  + `config.vue`: The vue component of the config UI,
    which is shown below the `<description>` given in `Codes.xml`.
    When the config is changed, store the new config into localStorage
    (with key = `config/YOUR_CODE_ID` as convention).
- Register `codegen.js` in `site/.vuepress/components/codes/codegen.js`
  and `config.vue` in `site/.vuepress/components/codes/ui.js`.
  Note that the name used in export must match the `<id>` of the code.

### Added 'Instant Restart' (GMSJ01 only)
Restarts the area without pausing.

## Mar 25, 2022
### Implemented dependencies system
Add `<dependencies>` tag in `<code>` (e.g. `<dependencies>dep1,dep2,dep3</dependencies>`)
to specify dependencies (separated by `,` if multiple).
The system will find code with id specified with `<id>` tag in `<code>` (e.g. `<id>dep1</id>`)

In addition, to specify dependencies for specific version, add the `version` attribute. e.g.
`<dependencies version="GMSJ01">dep1,dep4</dependencies>`

To prevent internal library being shown on code list,
specify the category as `lib` (i.e. `<category>lib</category>`).

### Added 'drawText' internal library
```c
void drawText(int x, int y, int fontSize, uint32_t colorTop, uint32_t colorBot, const char *fmt, ...);
```
Reserve `817F0238` to `817F0347` (0x110 bytes) for this function.

### Added 'Pattern Selector' (GMSJ01 only)
Select pattern of Chain Chomp (PV4) and Chain Chomplets (PV1).
This code use `drawText` as dependencies.

### Update 'Position/angle/speed display' and 'Speed display' (GMSJ01 only)
Use `drawText` function to simplify the code.

## Mar 13, 2022

### Added 'Metadata Display' category

Displays a health bar above Shadow Mario.

## Nov 28, 2021

### Updated 'Speed display'

Fixed a crash when leaving certain levels.

### Updated 'Quarterframe Timer (Experimental)'

- The timer now freezes upon grabbing blue or red coins.
- The timer now rounds to the frame for end times, entry times and blue coin grabs, as more precision in those cases would be meaningless.

## Nov 15, 2021

### Updated 'Quarterframe Timer (Experimental)'

- Revamped reset behavior; this code is now fully compatible with Shine Get Timer, and no longer depends on any loader code.
- The timer now freezes upon hitting a loading zone (similarly to Shine Get Timer) or exiting area.
- Fixed possible overflows when entering a loading zone after staying in the same area for a very long time.

## Oct 22, 2021

### Updated 'Quarterframe Timer (Experimental)'

- Adjusted speed to match real time on 30fps. The timer will run slightly faster than real time on 25fps PAL, just as the game itself does.
- Fixed the ability for the timer to eventually roll back to 0:00.000; it will now stop at 99:59.994 (the highest achievable time below 100 minutes).
- Fixed the ability for the timer to eventually resume while waiting on a Shine textbox; it will now keep displaying the end time forever (well, until the next area transition).

## Oct 10, 2021

### Added 'Speed Display' and 'Shiny Shines'

Speed Display is a more compact version of Position/angle/speed Display, and Shiny Shines simply makes all Shines yellow whether collected or not.

### Added code categories and presets

\-

## Sep 29, 2021

### Added 'Quarterframe Timer (Experimental)'

A new timer that aims to circumvent the Shine Get Timer's inconsistencies, and allow timing full levels where SGT would be interrupted by the in-game timer.

## Aug 13, 2021

### Removed 'Stage Randomizer' and 'Remove Save Boxes'

The stage randomizer was outdated by the more powerful stage loader. Removing save boxes has little use for practice and is banned for individual level runs, though it is still possible using 'Fast Any%' or the stage loader.

## Jul 24, 2021

### Added 'Coin Count Savestate'

Allows you to save and load your coin counts using the DPad. The mapping uses the same combination as the one for position saves/loads to simplify usage.

## Jul 5, 2021

### Updated 'Level Select'

Changed C-down + X from Sirena 5 casino to Sirena 4 casino. This shortcut was originally put in place to work around an old practice codes bug, but it now seems more sensible to repurpose it as a quick access to casino skip.

## Jul 1, 2021

### Renamed 'Fix Memory Card Encoding'

Nothing really ever was broken, you simply need to select the correct encoding for your memory card.

## Jun 10, 2021

## Mar 17, 2021

### Fixed 'Remove Save Boxes'

The previous version would just crash the game on boot. Good job me.

## Feb 15, 2021

Enabling this code no longer prevents you from saving through the pause menu.

## Jan 21, 2021

## Jun 25, 2020

Forces events to happen on certain versions of the plaza.

## Feb 28, 2020

### Updated 'Level Select'. Added 'Shine Touch Timer'. Marked original IGT as deprecated.

The Original Ingame Timer has been marked as deprecated. You can still find it on the bottom of the codelist though if you still want to use it. Instead, there are now two other timers:

- Shine Touch Timer: Starts on the last black frame of the loading screen and ends when you touch the shine.
- Shine Get Timer: Starts on the last black frame of the loading screen and ends when the Shine Get animation starts (similiar to the x-cam timer of SM64).

Since the Shine Get timer contained a way better Level Select, the Level Select code has been replaced with the one from the timer. It includes the most recent fixes and also has some maintenance advantages.

### Timer Changes:

### Changed timing (see above).

- Resets on death.
- Resets when using Shine Select.
- Only uses existing timers for Piantissimo, Sirena/Pianta 6 and Ricco 2 underground.
- Fixed Pinna 8 HUD.

#### Known Bugs:

- Can't reset Pinna 8 properly after finishing the rollercoaster. Use the cannon to reenter or reset the game instead.
- Box game timer doesn't work properly.

### Updated Level Select

- Mashing A during loading screens doesn't affect your level selection anymore.
- Pinna game resets have been fixed.
- Level Names in the intro have been fixed (shoutouts to Noki Doki).
- Sirena 5 now loads the right casino.
- Reloading Sirena does no longer respawn you in the Hotel. Reason: You can move earlier than usual if you do that, making it too inaccurate for practice.

### Replaced 'Exit Area Everywhere' and 'Pause Mid-Air' with 'Free Pause'.

- Merged the two codes.

## Nov 06, 2017

### Added 'Free Pause'

'Free Pause' replaces 'Enable Pause Mid-Air' and 'Enable Exit Area Everywhere'. It now also allows you to pause during cutscenes.
